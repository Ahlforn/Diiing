# Diing!

Once upon a time, I wrote a simple little add-on, called Hey, Grays Mon! But as happens from time to time, add-on authors stop playing the game and so did I. Now, I'm back but I have lost access to my old account, so time to remake the add-on. Because who doesn't love getting congratulated for one's hard work?
